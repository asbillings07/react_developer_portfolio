            It's already been over year since I started my coding journey.
            Before I was a developer, I was a support manager. I really enjoyed
            helping customers and helping my team grow.

            However, I was always curious about how these issues were solved.
            That curiousity lead me into the world of Software development. I
            loved what I was learning so much that I would spend most of my
            waking hours reading coding books, watching tutorials, and working
            on projects.

            When I join the Treehouse Techdegree program, my passion for
            developing pushed me to code at least 8 hours a day while working a
            full time 9-5 job. I would wake up everyday at 4:30am, get to work
            by 5am, then code until 9am. I would work my full-time job until
            12pm, code during lunch, then work my job again until 5pm. After
            which I would come home and code from 8pm until 12am.

            I'm still amazed that I able to purse my passion and make a living.
            I never would have thought that was possible years ago. Coding makes
            me excited to get up in the morning, and pushes me to learn new
            languages and technologies. I am very passionate about software
            development and enjoy encouraging others that are on the same path.

            When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two
            daughters, playing video games, and watching movies.
